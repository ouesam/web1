    <h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p><strong><u>Hypertext Markup Language</u> (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup
    language for documents
    designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies
    such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
    render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
    of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of
    the document.

        CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout,colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content, such as semantically insignificant tables that were widely used to format pages before consistent CSS rendering was available in all major browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate presentation instructions from the HTML content in a separate file or style section of the HTML file. For each matching HTML element, it provides a list of formatting instructions. For example, a CSS rule might specify that "all heading 1 elements should be bold", leaving pure semantic HTML markup that asserts "this text is a level 1 heading" without formatting code such as a <bold> tag indicating how such text should be displayed.
